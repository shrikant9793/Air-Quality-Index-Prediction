# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
GOAL

The goal of this project is to predict Air Quality Index (AQI ) form features as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), Nitrogen Oxide (NO), Nitric Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone (O3) etc.


Conclusion

Accuracy of Regression models- Linear regression, lasso regression and rigde regression is almost same.

Whereas accuracy of decision tree regressor is higher and root mean sqaure error is least.

Decision tree regressor is more efficient model.
